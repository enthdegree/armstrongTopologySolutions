\section{Extra Proofs and Lemmas}

    \subsection{Limit Points, Closure and Density}
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    
        \item Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space, and $A \subset X$. We show that $\bar{A} = A \cup L_A$, where $L_A$ is the set of all accumulation points of $A$:
            \begin{proof} If $\bar{A} = A$, then by Theorem $2.2$, pg. $29$, $L_A \subset A$ and we are done. So, suppose that $A$ is not closed. Then, $A$ does not contain all of its limit points; consequently, $L_A \neq \emptyset$. Further, the set $B = A \cup L_A$ is closed by Theorem $2.2$, pg. $29$. 
            \par To conclude the proof, we show that any closed set $C$ containing $A$, contains $B$. Indeed; Let $C \subset X$ be closed, such that $A \subset C$. Now, for $a \in L_A$ and open set $O_a$ containing $a$, we have that $A \cap (O_a - \{a\}) \neq \emptyset$. But, as $A \subset C$, we have $C \cap (O_a - \{a\}) \neq \emptyset$. Therefore, $a \subset C$. So, $L_A \subset C$, implying $A \cup L_A \subset C$. By Theorem $2.3$, pg. $30$, $\bar{A} = B = A \cup L_A$.
            \end{proof}
            
        \item Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space, and $A \subset X$. We prove that $L_A$, defined above, contains all limit points of sequences contained in $A$:\footnote{This assumes the general definition of limit points of a set}
            \begin{proof} Let $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty \subset A$, such that $a_n \rightarrow a$. Then, $a \in L_{\{a_n: n \in \mathbb{N}\}}$ and every neighbourhood of $a$ contains a point of $\{a_n: n \in \mathbb{N}\} - \{a\} = B$. As $\{a_n: n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset A$, every neighbourhood of $a$ has a point in $A - \{a\}$; $a \in L_A$. 
            \end{proof}
            
        \item Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space, and $A \subset X$ such that $\bar{A} = X$. We prove that $A \cap O \neq \emptyset$, for all $O \neq \emptyset$, $O \in \tau$: 
            \begin{proof} Suppose that for some $O \in \tau$, $O \neq \emptyset$, $A \cap O = \emptyset$. By a previous lemma, we have $\bar{A} = (L_A - A) \cup O^c$, implying $O^c = A$. But then we have $X = O^c = \bar{O^c} = \bar{A}$, as $O$ is open. But, contrarily, this implies that $(O^c)^c = O = X^c = \emptyset$.  
            \end{proof}
            
        \item We prove that the intersection of a closed set and a compact set is always compact: 
            \begin{proof} Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space. Let $H,K \subset X$, such that $H$ is closed and $K$ is compact. Consider $H \cap K$. Now, if $\{O_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha}$ is an open cover of $H \cap K$, then $K \subset \bigcup_{\alpha \in N} O_\alpha \cup (X - H)$. But, since $H$ is closed, $X - H$ is open. In conclusion, as 
            $$H \cap K \subset \bigcup_{\alpha \in N} O_\alpha \cup (X - H)$$
            such a finite subcover of $H \cap K$ exists. 
            \end{proof}
            
    \end{enumerate}
    
    
    \subsection{Separation}
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    
        \item We show that a compact $T_2$ space $T_3$. Consequently, we show that it is $T_4$: 
            \begin{proof} Let $X$ be the compact $T_2$ space. We first show that $X$ is $T_3$: 
            \par Let $A \subset X$, such that $A$ is closed. Then $A$ is compact. Further, let $b \in X$ such that $b \notin A$. Now, for each $a \in A$, there exists an open set $O_a$, and some open set $O_b^a$, such that $O_a \cap O_b^a = \emptyset$. It follows that $A \subset \bigcup_{a \in N} O_a \subset \bigcup_a O_a$ and that $\bigcup_{a \in N} O_a = O_A$ is open. Further, $b \in \bigcap_{a \in N} O_b^a = O_b$, is open. And by construction, we have $O_A \cap O_b = \emptyset$. So, $X$ is $T_3$. 
            \par To show that $X$ is $T_4$, let $A, B \subset X$, be disjoint and closed. Then, arguing as above, we have two disjoint open subsets $O_B \in \tau$, $O_A \in \tau$ with $O_A \cap O_B = \emptyset$. 
            \end{proof}
            
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \subsection{Compactness}
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    
        \item We show that a homeomorphism between locally compact $T_2$ spaces, $X$, $Y$, extends to a homeomorphism between the Alexandroff compactifications; in other-words, locally compact homeomorphic $T_2$ spaces have homeomorphic one point compactifications. 
            \begin{proof} Suppose that $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is the homeomorphism. Define $g: X \cup \{\infty_1\} \rightarrow Y \cup \{\infty_2\}$ as follows: 
                $$ g(x) = 
                \begin{cases} 
                    f(x) & x \neq \infty_1 \\
                    \infty_2 & x = \infty_1
                \end{cases}
                $$
            It is clear that as $f$ is a bijection, so is $g$. We show that $g$ is a homeomorphism: 
            \par Suppose that $U$ is open in $Y$. Then, $g^{-1}[U] = f^{-1}[U]$, which is open in $X \cup \{\infty_1\}$. 
            \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    
    
    
    
    
    \subsection{Homotopy Type}
        \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
            \item We prove that if $A$ is a subspace of a topological space $X$ and  $G: X \times I \rightarrow X$ is deformation retract relative to $A$, then $X$ and $A$ have the same homotopy type\footnote{Armstrong does not do a good job of defining a deformation retract. We use the following definition. "Strong" deformation retract: $A$ is a 'strong' deformation retract of $X$ iff there exists a map $D:X \times I \rightarrow X$ such that $D(a,t)=a$ for every $a \in A$, $D(x,0)=x$ and $D(x,1) \in A$ for all $x \in X$. See \href{http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/488527/deformation-retract-and-homotopy-equivalence}{this post on SE.}}: 
                \begin{proof} Indeed: Let $f:A \rightarrow X$ be the inclusion map and $g: X \rightarrow A$ be defined by $g(x) = G(x,1)$. We have previously shown that $f$ and $g$ are continuous. It is only left to show that $f \circ g \simeq 1_X$ and $g \circ f \simeq 1_A$:
                \par Direct computation shows that 
                    \begin{align*}
                        (g \circ f)(a) & = g(f(a)) = g(a) = G(a,1) = a,
                    \end{align*}
                while $f \circ g \simeq_G 1_X$. This completes the proof. 

                \end{proof}
            \item We show that any non-empty convex subset, $X$, of a euclidean space is homotopy equivalent to a point: 
                \begin{proof} 
                Without loss of generality, we assume that $X \subset \E^n$. We first show the existence of a deformation retract, $G: X \times I \hookrightarrow \{x\}$, where $x \in X$ is fixed:
                \par Let $G$ be defined as $G(y,t) = (1-t)y + tx$, for all $y \in X$. Then, clearly $G(y,0) = y$, and $G(y,1) = x \in \{x\}$ for all $y \in X$. So, $G$ is deformation retract. By the above, $X$ and $A$ are of the same homotopy type: null-homotopic. 
                \end{proof}
 
        \end{enumerate}

\section{Homotopy Type}
\par Throughout this section, $\simeq$ will typically denote homotopy equivalence.
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
        \item If $X \simeq Y$ and $X' \simeq Y'$, we show that $X \times X' \simeq Y \times Y'$: 
            \begin{proof} We are given maps $f: X \rightarrow Y$, $g: Y \rightarrow X$, $f':X' \rightarrow Y'$ and $g': Y' \rightarrow X'$, such that $g \circ f \simeq_{\gamma'} 1_X$, $f \circ g \simeq_{\gamma} 1_Y$, $g' \circ f' \simeq_{\delta '} 1_{X'}$ and $f' \circ g' \simeq_{\delta} 1_{Y'}$. 
            \par From the component-wise definition of the product topology, $F: X \times X' \rightarrow Y \times Y'$, defined by $F(x,x') = (f(x), f'(x'))$, and $G: Y \times Y' \rightarrow X \times X'$, defined by $G(y,y') = (g(y), g'(y'))$ are continuous. Further, $F \circ G \simeq 1_{Y \times Y'}$, and $G \circ F \simeq 1_{X \times X'}$, via the canonical maps, component-wise defined: $\mathcal{F}:(X \times X') \times I \rightarrow X \times X'$, $\mathcal{F} \equiv (\gamma', \delta')$, and $\mathcal{G}:(Y \times Y') \times I \rightarrow Y \times Y'$, $\mathcal{G} \equiv (\gamma, \delta)$, respectively. 
            \par Thus, $X \times X' \simeq Y \times Y'$.
            \end{proof}
            
        \item We show that the cone, $CX$, is contractible for any space $(X, \tau_X)$:
            \begin{proof} By definition, we have $CX = \nicefrac{X \times I}{X\times \{1\}}$. Define ${H}: CX \times I \rightarrow CX$ by $${H}((x,t),s) = (x, t(1-s))$$ Then, we have 
                \begin{align*}
                    {H}((x,t), 0) & = (x,t) = 1_{CX} \\
                    {H}((x,t),1) & = (x,0) 
                \end{align*}
            Now, if $\Ocal_{CX} \in \tau_{CX}$, then $H^{-1}(\Ocal_{CX}) = (\Ocal_{CX}, I) \in  CX \times I$. Thus, $H$ is continuous. This proves the result. 
            \end{proof}
    
        \item We show that the punctured torus deformation retracts onto the one-point union of two circles. 
        
        \item For each of the following cases, we choose as base point in $C$ and describe the generators for the fundamental groups of $C$ and $S$. Further, we write down the homomorphism, in terms of these generators, the fundamental groups induced by the inclusion of $C$ in $S$. 
        \par Consider the following examples of a circle $C$ embedded in a surface $S$: 
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item $S = \text{M{\"o}bius Strip}$ and $C = \partial S$: 
                \item $S = S^1 \times S^1 = T^1$ and $C = \{(x.y) \in T^1 : x = y\}$:
                \item $S = S^1 \times I$ and $C = S^1 \times 1$:
            \end{enumerate}
            
        \item Suppose that $f,g: S^1 \rightarrow X$ are homotopic maps. We prove that the spaces formed from $X$ by attaching a disc, using $f$ and using $g$ are homotopy equivalent; in other words, we prove that $X \cup_f D \simeq X \cup_g D$: 
        
        \item We use the previous problem, and the third example of homotopy given in section $5.1$, to show that the 'dunce hat' has the homotopy type of a disc, and is therefore contractible: 
        
        \item We show that the 'house with two rooms' is contractible: 
        
        \item We give a detailed proof to show that the cylinder and the M{\"o}bius strip have the homotopy type of the circle: 
        
        \item Let $X$ be the comb space. We prove that the identity map of $X$ is not homotopic $\text{rel} \{p\}$, to the constant map, $p$. 
        
        \item \textit{FTA}: We prove the fundamental theorem of algebra: 
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem}
\par Throughout, we say a topological space $(X, \tau_X)$ has the fixed-point property if every continuous function from $X$ to itself has a fixed point. 

    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
        \item We determine which of the following have the fixed point property: 
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The $2$-Sphere: $S^2$ does not exhibit the fixed point property. 
                    \begin{proof}
                    We have previously shown that the map $f:S^n \rightarrow S^n$, given by $f(x) = -x$ is a homeomorphism.
                    \end{proof}
                    
                \item The Torus: $T^1 = S^1 \times S^1$ does not exhibit the fixed point property. 
                    \begin{proof}
                    As $T^1 = S^1 \times S^1$, and the antipodal map, $f$, on $S^1$ is a homeomorphism, we have that $F: T^1 \rightarrow T^1$, defined by $F((x,y)) = (f(x),f(y))$, is continuous and doesn't exhibit the fixed point property. 
                    \end{proof}
                    
                \item The interior of the unit disc: $\text{Int}D^1$ does not exhibit the fixed point property: 
                    \begin{proof} Note that the interior of the unit disc is homeomorphic to the euclidean plane by a homeomorphism $h: \text{Int}D^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{E}^2$. We define a function $g$ from the euclidean plane to the euclidean plane by $g((x,y))=(x+1,y)$. Then, $h^{-1}\circ g\circ h$ is a continuous function from the disc to itself that has no fixed point.
                    \end{proof}
                    
                \item The one point union of two circles: $X \vee Y = \nicefrac{ X  \amalg Y }{\{p\}}$ does not exhibit the fixed point property: 
                    \begin{proof} Define a function $f$ as follows: If $x\in X$ then we map $e^{ix}$ to $e^{i(x+\pi)}$. Also if $y \in Y$, we map $y$ to $f(p)=e^{\nicefrac{i\pi}{2}}$. This function $f$, as defined on the one point union, leaves no points fixed.
                    \end{proof}
            \end{enumerate}
            
        \item Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are of the same homotopy type and $X$ has the fixed-point property. We prove that $Y$ does not necessarily have the fixed point property: 
            \begin{proof} Let $Y$ be the subspace $(0,1) \subset \E^n$, and let $X = \{1/2\}$. Note that $Y$ is homotopic to $X$ by the straight line homotopy, and every map from $X$ to itself has a fixed point. Yet, the function $f: Y \rightarrow Y$, defined by $f(y)=y^2$ has no fixed point. 
            \end{proof}
            
        \item Suppose that $X$ retracts onto the subspace $A \subset X$, and that $A$ has the fixed point property. We show that $X$ may not exhibit the fixed point property: 
            \begin{proof} Take $X$ and $Y$, as above. The straight-line homotopy proves the assertion. 
            \end{proof}
        
        
        \item We show that if $X$ retracts onto the subspace $A$, and $X$ has the fixed-point property, then $A$ also has it: 
            \begin{proof} Let $f:A\rightarrow X$ be a continuous function. Since $X$ retracts onto $A$, there exists a map $g:X\rightarrow A$ such that $g \restriction{A} \equiv 1_A$. Then, $f \circ g$ is a continuous function from $X$ to $X$, and so has a fixed point. Hence, there exists an $a\in A$ such that $f(g(a))=f(a)=a$. This completes the proof. 
            \end{proof}
            
        \item We deduce that the fixed-point property holds for the 'house with two rooms', $X$: 
            \begin{proof} Let $f:X \rightarrow X$ be a map. By exercise $29$, pg. $109$, we know that $X$ is contractible. By an extra lemma\footnote{reference this.}, we have that $X$ retracts onto a point $p \in X$. Thus, there exists a map $g:X \rightarrow X$, such that $g\restriction{\{p\}} \equiv 1_p$. Further, $f,g$ are homotopy equivalent. Thus, there exists a map $H: X \times I \rightarrow X$, such that $H(x,0) = f(x)$, and $H(x,1) = g(x)$. So, $H(p,1) = p$. Consequently, $f(p) = f(H(p,1)) = H(p,0) = H^{-1}(p,1) = $
            \end{proof}
            
        \item Let $f$ be a fixed-point-free map from a compact metric space $(X,d)$ to itself. We prove there is a positive number $\epsilon$ such that $d(x,f(x)) > \epsilon$, $\forall x\in X$: 
            \begin{proof} We show the contrapositive; Suppose that for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists an element $x \in X$ such that $d(x,f(x)) \leq \epsilon$. Pick $x_1\in X$ such that $d(x_1,f(x)) \leq \frac{1}{2} < 1$.
            \par It follows that there exists a set, $\{x_1,...,x_n\}\subset X$ such that $d(x_i,f(x_i)) <d(x_k,f(x_k))$, where $i<k$ and $d(x_k,f(x_k))<\dfrac{1}{k}$, for all $1\leq k\leq n$.
            \par Now, let 
            $$\epsilon_0 = \dfrac{1}{2}\min \Big\{d(x_1,f(x_1)),...,d(x_n,f(x_n),\frac{1}{n+1}\Big\}$$
            Then there exists an element $x\in X$ such that $d(x,f(x))\leq\epsilon_0$. Pick $x\in X$ that satisfies this property, and call this $x_{n+1}$. Note here that $d(x_n,f(x_n)) < d(x_{n+1},f(x_{n+1}))$ by construction. So that for all $i<n+1$, $d(x_i,f(x_i))\leq d(x_n,f(x_n))< d(x_{n+1},f(x_{n+1}))$. Thus by induction, we have created an infinite sequence $\{x_n\}_{n = 1}^\infty$ of distinct points such that $d(x_k,f(x_k))<\nicefrac{1}{k}$ for each positive integer $k$. And, $\{d(x_n,f(x_n))\}_n$ is a monotone decreasing sequence.
            \par Since $X$ is compact, every infinite subset has a limit point. Therefore $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty $ has a limit point $x \in X$. 
            \par Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Since $f$ is continuous at $x$, then there exists a $\delta >0$ such that $d(x,a)<\delta\implies d(f(x),f(a)<\nicefrac{\epsilon}{3}$ for all $a\in X$. By the Archimedian Property, we can find a positive integer $k$, such that 
            $$\frac{1}{k}<\frac{\epsilon}{3}$$
            Set $r= \min\{\dfrac{\epsilon}{3},\delta\}$. Then, since $x$ is a limit point of $\{x_n\}_{n = 1}^\infty$, there are infinitely many points of the sequence, such that $d(x_N,x)<r$. Thus, there exists a point $x_N$ such that $N>k$ and $d(x_N,x)<r$. Since $d(x_N,x)<\delta$, then $d(f(x_N),f(x))<\nicefrac{\epsilon}{3}$. Since $N>k$,  $$d(x_N,f(x_N)) < d(x_k,f(x_k)) < \nicefrac{1}{k} < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$$
            Therefore $$d(x,f(x))\leq d(x,x_N)+d(x_N,f(x_N))+d(f(x_N),f(x))<\frac{\epsilon}{3}+\frac{\epsilon}{3}+\frac{\epsilon}{3}=\epsilon$$
            \par Thus, for all $\epsilon>0$, we have that $d(x,f(x))<\epsilon$. Thus, $d(x,f(x)) \leq 0$, and hence $d(x,f(x))=0$. Consequently, $f(x)=x$, and so $f$ is not a fixed-point-free map.
            \end{proof}
            
    \end{enumerate}
