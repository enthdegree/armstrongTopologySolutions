\section{Definitions}

    \subsection{Functions}
        \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
            \item Let $f:A \rightarrow B$ be a function. Then, 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item $f$ is onto if, and only if, there exists a function $g: B \rightarrow A$ such that $fg = 1_B$.
                    \item $f$ is one-to-one if, and only if, there exists a function $g: B \rightarrow A$ such that $gf = 1_A$ (provided $A$ is non-empty). 
                    \item $f$ Is in 1-1 correspondence if there exists a function $g: B \rightarrow A$ such that $fg = 1_B$ and $gf = 1_A$. In this case, $g$ is unique and is called the inverse function of $f$, typically denoted $f^{-1}$. 
                \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}


\section{Extra Proofs and Lemmas}

    \subsection{Group Theory \& Abstract Algebra}
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
        \item Split Exact Sequence: Given an exact sequence of abeilean groups and homomorphisms, 
        \[0 \xrightarrow[]{} G \xrightarrow{\theta} H \xrightarrow{\phi} K \xrightarrow[]{} 0, \]
        and a homomorphism $\psi: K \rightarrow H$, such that $\phi\psi \equiv 1_K$, we have $H \cong G \oplus K$. 
            \begin{proof}
                Define $\alpha: G \oplus K \rightarrow H$ by $\alpha(g \oplus k) = \theta(g) + \psi(k)$: it is easy to see that $\alpha$ is a homomorphism. Also, $\alpha$ is (1-1), for if $\alpha(g \oplus k) = 0$, we have 
                \[0 = \phi(\theta(g) + \psi(k)) = \phi\psi(k) = k;\]
                but, then $\theta(g) = 0$, so that $g = 0$ since $\theta$ is one-to-one. 
                \par Moreover, $\alpha$ is onto, since given $h \in H$, we have 
                \[\phi(h - \psi\phi(h)) = \phi(h) - \phi\psi\phi(h) = 0\]
                Thus, there exists $g \in G$ such that $h - \psi\phi(k) = \theta(g)$, that is, 
                \[h = \theta(g) + \psi\phi(h) = \alpha(g \oplus \psi(h))\]
            \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    
    \subsection{Limit Points, Closure \& Density}
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    
        \item Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space, and $A \subset X$. We show that $\bar{A} = A \cup L_A$, where $L_A$ is the set of all accumulation points of $A$:
            \begin{proof} If $\bar{A} = A$, then by Theorem $2.2$, pg. $29$, $L_A \subset A$ and we are done. So, suppose that $A$ is not closed. Then, $A$ does not contain all of its limit points; consequently, $L_A \neq \emptyset$. Further, the set $B = A \cup L_A$ is closed by Theorem $2.2$, pg. $29$. 
            \par To conclude the proof, we show that any closed set $C$ containing $A$, contains $B$. Indeed; Let $C \subset X$ be closed, such that $A \subset C$. Now, for $a \in L_A$ and open set $O_a$ containing $a$, we have that $A \cap (O_a - \{a\}) \neq \emptyset$. But, as $A \subset C$, we have $C \cap (O_a - \{a\}) \neq \emptyset$. Therefore, $a \subset C$. So, $L_A \subset C$, implying $A \cup L_A \subset C$. By Theorem $2.3$, pg. $30$, $\bar{A} = B = A \cup L_A$.
            \end{proof}
            
        \item Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space, and $A \subset X$. We prove that $L_A$, defined above, contains all limit points of sequences contained in $A$:\footnote{This assumes the general definition of limit points of a set}
            \begin{proof} Let $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty \subset A$, such that $a_n \rightarrow a$. Then, $a \in L_{\{a_n: n \in \mathbb{N}\}}$ and every neighbourhood of $a$ contains a point of $\{a_n: n \in \mathbb{N}\} - \{a\} = B$. As $\{a_n: n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset A$, every neighbourhood of $a$ has a point in $A - \{a\}$; $a \in L_A$. 
            \end{proof}
            
        \item Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space, and $A \subset X$ such that $\bar{A} = X$. We prove that $A \cap O \neq \emptyset$, for all $O \neq \emptyset$, $O \in \tau$: 
            \begin{proof} Suppose that for some $O \in \tau$, $O \neq \emptyset$, $A \cap O = \emptyset$. By a previous lemma, we have $\bar{A} = (L_A - A) \cup O^c$, implying $O^c = A$. But then we have $X = O^c = \bar{O^c} = \bar{A}$, as $O$ is open. But, contrarily, this implies that $(O^c)^c = O = X^c = \emptyset$.  
            \end{proof}
            
        \item We prove that the intersection of a closed set and a compact set is always compact: 
            \begin{proof} Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space. Let $H,K \subset X$, such that $H$ is closed and $K$ is compact. Consider $H \cap K$. Now, if $\{O_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha}$ is an open cover of $H \cap K$, then $K \subset \bigcup_{\alpha \in N} O_\alpha \cup (X - H)$. But, since $H$ is closed, $X - H$ is open. In conclusion, as 
            $$H \cap K \subset \bigcup_{\alpha \in N} O_\alpha \cup (X - H)$$
            such a finite subcover of $H \cap K$ exists. 
            \end{proof}
            
        \item We prove that if $(X, d)$ is a metric space with the induced topology, then $C \subset X$ is closed if, and only if, whenever $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a sequence in $C$, with $\{a_n\} \rightarrow L$, we have $L \in C$: 
            \begin{proof} 
                \begin{enumerate}
                $ $\newline
                    \item[] ($\implies$): Suppose, to the contrary, that $\bar{C} = C$, but $L \notin C$. Thus, there exists some $\epsilon > 0$, such that $B_\epsilon(L) \cap C = \emptyset$, as $L$ is not a limit point of $C$. But then, $a_n \notin B_\epsilon(L)$, for all $n \geq N$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$ is sufficiently large; A contradiction. 
                    \item[] ($\impliedby$): Suppose, to the contrary, that $\bar{C} \neq C$. Then, by extra lemma\footnote{reference this}, there is some $l \in L_C$, such that $L \notin C$. Thus, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we pick $a_n \in B_{\nicefrac{1}{n}}(L) \cap C \neq \emptyset$. Consequently, $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a sequence in $C$ such that $a_n \rightarrow L \in C$, by hypothesis; A contradiction.
                \end{enumerate}
            \end{proof}
            
    \end{enumerate}
    
    
    
    \subsection{Separation}
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    
        \item We show that a compact $T_2$ space $T_3$. Consequently, we show that it is $T_4$: 
            \begin{proof} Let $X$ be the compact $T_2$ space. We first show that $X$ is $T_3$: 
            \par Let $A \subset X$, such that $A$ is closed. Then $A$ is compact. Further, let $b \in X$ such that $b \notin A$. Now, for each $a \in A$, there exists an open set $O_a$, and some open set $O_b^a$, such that $O_a \cap O_b^a = \emptyset$. It follows that $A \subset \bigcup_{a \in N} O_a \subset \bigcup_a O_a$ and that $\bigcup_{a \in N} O_a = O_A$ is open. Further, $b \in \bigcap_{a \in N} O_b^a = O_b$, is open. And by construction, we have $O_A \cap O_b = \emptyset$. So, $X$ is $T_3$. 
            \par To show that $X$ is $T_4$, let $A, B \subset X$, be disjoint and closed. Then, arguing as above, we have two disjoint open subsets $O_B \in \tau$, $O_A \in \tau$ with $O_A \cap O_B = \emptyset$. 
            \end{proof}
            
    \end{enumerate}
    
    
    
    \subsection{Compactness}
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    
        \item We show that a homeomorphism between locally compact $T_2$ spaces, $X$, $Y$, extends to a homeomorphism between the Alexandroff compactifications; in other-words, locally compact homeomorphic $T_2$ spaces have homeomorphic one point compactifications. 
            \begin{proof} Suppose that $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is the homeomorphism. Define $g: X \cup \{\infty_1\} \rightarrow Y \cup \{\infty_2\}$ as follows: 
                $$ g(x) = 
                \begin{cases} 
                    f(x) & x \neq \infty_1 \\
                    \infty_2 & x = \infty_1
                \end{cases}
                $$
            It is clear that as $f$ is a bijection, so is $g$. We show that $g$ is a homeomorphism: 
            \par Suppose that $U$ is open in $Y$. Then, $g^{-1}[U] = f^{-1}[U]$, which is open in $X \cup \{\infty_1\}$. Now, if ${\Ocal}$ is open in $Y \cup \{\infty_2\}$, we have ${\Ocal} = K \cup \{\infty_2\}$, where $K \subset Y$ is compact. Then, 
            $$g^{-1}[{\Ocal}] = g^{-1}[K \cup \{\infty_2\}] = g^{-1}[K] \cup g^{-1}[\{\infty_2\}] =g^{-1}[K] \cup \{\infty_1\}$$
            which is open in $X \cup \{\infty_1\}$. 
            \par Consequently, as $g$ is one-to-one and onto, since $f$ is, $g$ is a homeomorphism by Theorem $3.7$, pg. $48$.
            \end{proof}
            
        \item We show that if $(X, \tau)$ is a topological space, and $S \subset X$ is compact, then if $W$ is a neighbourhood of $S$, there exists another neighbourhood $G$, such that 
        $$S \subset G \subset W$$
            \begin{proof} By exercise $21$, section $3$ pg. $55$, and the fact that $X \cup \{y\} \cong X$, the result follows.  
            \end{proof}
    
    \end{enumerate}
    
    
    \subsection{Quotient Maps \& Quotient Topology}
        \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
            \item We show that if $q: X \rightarrow Y$ is a quotient map\footnote{Armstrong does not do a good job describing what the topology on $Y$ is. A simple exercise shows that by letting ${\Ocal}$ be open in $Y$ whenever $q^{-1}[{\Ocal}]$ is open in $X$, we have a topology on $Y$; call this $\tau_{Y}$. Further, Armstrong does not do an adequate job describing what a quotient map is: $q: X \rightarrow Y$ is a quotient map if it is onto, continuous with respect to $\tau_Y$, and such that $g^{-1}[{\Ocal}]$ is open in $X$ implies ${\Ocal}$ open in $Y$. We can summarize by saying that $q$ is onto, and such that ${\Ocal}$ is open in $Y$ iff $g^{-1}[{\Ocal}]$ is open in $X$.}, then the topology of $Y$ is the largest which makes $q$ continuous: 
                \begin{proof} Suppose that $\tau$ was some other topology on $Y$, such that $q$ was continuous. We conclude by showing that $\tau \subset \tau_Y$:
                \par Indeed; if ${\Ocal} \in \tau$, then $q^{-1}[{\Ocal}]$ is open in $X$. But then, $q[q^{-1}[{\Ocal}]] = {\Ocal} \in \tau_Y$. Thus, $\tau \subset \tau_Y$. 
                \end{proof}
                
            \item Suppose that $(X, \tau)$ is a topological space, and $A$ a non-empty set. We show that if $f: X \rightarrow A$, then the quotient topology on $A$, $\tau_A$ is indeed a topology: 
                \begin{proof} By definition, as noted above, ${\Ocal}$ is open in $A$, if $f^{-1}[{\Ocal}]$ is open in $X$:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item As $f^{-1}[\emptyset] = \emptyset$, and $f^{-1}[A] = X$, $\emptyset, A \in \tau_A$.
                        \item As $$f^{-1}[\bigcup_{j \in J} {\Ocal}_j] = \bigcup_{j \in J} f^{-1}[{\Ocal}_j],$$ we see that $\bigcup_{j \in J} {\Ocal}_j \in \tau_A$.
                        \item Lastly, $$f^{-1}[\bigcap_{j =1 }^\infty {\Ocal}_j] = \bigcap_{j =1}^\infty f^{-1}[{\Ocal}_j]$$ So, $\bigcap_{j =1 }^\infty {\Ocal}_j \in \tau_A$. 
                    \end{enumerate}
                \end{proof}
                
            \item We show that projective real n-space, $\mathbb{P}^n$, is Hausdorff\footnote{Credit for the initial idea of the proof goes to Brain M. Scott. In addtion, we use the notation $B(z,z')$ for the open ball of radius $z'$, centered at $z$.}: 
                \begin{proof} Let $q:S^n \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^n$ be the quotient map, and suppose that $u,v \in \mathbb{P}^n$, $u \neq v$; there are such $x,y \in S^n$, such that $q^{-1}[\{u\}] = \{x, -x\}$, and $q^{-1}[\{v\}] = \{y, -y\}$. We exhibit an $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ such that the open neighbourhoods of radius $\epsilon$, centered at $u,v$ are disjoint: 
                \par Let $$\epsilon = \frac{1}{2} \min\{ ||x - y ||, ||x +y||\},$$ and set $U = B(x,\epsilon)$, and $V = B(y, \epsilon)$. It follows form the construction of $U,V$, that $U,V,-U,-V$ are pairwise disjoint, and open neighbourhoods of $x,y,-x,-y \in S^n$. Moreover, as noted above, $q^{-1}(q[U]) = U \cup -U$, and $q^{-1}(q[V]) = V \cup -V$. To conclude, we show that $q[U] \cap q[V]$ are disjoint neighbourhoods for $u,v \in \mathbb{P}^n$. 
                \par Indeed; 
                    \begin{align*}
                        q[U] \cap q[V] & = q[B(x, \epsilon) \cap S^n] \cap q[B(y, \epsilon) \cap S^n] \\
                        & = q[B(x, \epsilon)] \cap q[B(y, \epsilon)] \cap \mathbb{P}^n \\
                        & = B(u, q(\epsilon)) \cap B(v, q(\epsilon)) \cap \mathbb{P}^n \\
                        & = B_1 \cap B_2 \cap \mathbb{P}^n 
                    \end{align*}
                Now, if $B_1 \cap B_2 \neq \emptyset$, then we would have $q^{-1}[B_1 \cap B_2] = U \cap V \neq \emptyset$, contary to assumption. Thus, 
                $$q[U] \cap q[V] = \emptyset \cap \mathbb{P}^n = \emptyset$$
                \end{proof}
                
        \end{enumerate}
    
    
    \subsection{Topological Groups}
        \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
        
            \item Suppose that $(G, \tau, *)$ is a topological group. Fixing $x \in G$, we show that $x{\Ocal}\in \tau$ if, and only if, ${\Ocal} \in \tau$: 
                \begin{proof} 
                $ $\newline
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item [] ($\implies$): Suppose that $x{\Ocal} \in \tau$. It follows from pg. $75$, that $L_{x^{-1}}: G \rightarrow G$ is a homeomorphism and an open map: thus, $L_{x^{-1}}[{\Ocal}] \in \tau$.
                        \item [] ($\impliedby$): Suppose that ${\Ocal} \in \tau$. Then, as noted on pg. $75$, $L_x: G \rightarrow G$ is a homeomorphism and an open map: thus, $L_x[{\Ocal}] = x{\Ocal} \in \tau$.  
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{proof}
                
            \item Suppose that $(G, \tau, *)$ is a topological group. We show that ${\Ocal}$ is a neighbourhood of $x \in G$, if, and only if, $x^{-1}{\Ocal}$ is a neighbourhood of $e$: 
                \begin{proof} Suppose that $x \in G$, and without loss of generality, ${\Ocal}$ is an open set containing $x$. Then, by a previous lemma\footnote{reference this}, $L_{x^{-1}}[{\Ocal}] = x^{-1}{\Ocal} \in \tau$, and contains $x^{-1}x = e$.
                \par By considering $L_x$, similar logic shows the reverse implication. 
                \end{proof}
                
            \item We show that $\R$, with the Euclidean topology and addition is a topological group: 
                \begin{proof} The fact that $(\R, +)$ is a group is clear. To conclude, we show that $+ \equiv m:\R \rightarrow \R$, and $-1 \equiv i: \R \rightarrow \R$ are continuous:
                \par Now, $i(x) = -x$, which is polynomial, and so continuous. And, as $m(x,y) = x + y = P_1(x,y) + P_2(x,y)$, where $P_i$ is the projection mapping from $\R^{2}$, $m$ is continuous; it is the sum of two continuous functions. 
                \par A similar argument show that $(\R^{n}, \tau, +)$ is a topological group.
                \end{proof}
                
            \item Let $(G, \tau, m)$ be a topological group. We show that the topological automorphisms of $(G, \tau, m)$, for a subgroup of $\text(Aut)(G)$. We denote the set of all topological automorphism of $G$ by $\Aut_\tau (G)$. 
                \begin{proof} It is well known that $(\Aut (G), \circ)$ is a group. We show that $(\Aut_\tau (G), \circ)$ is a group: 
                \par As the composition of automorphism/homeomorphisms is another automorphism/homeomorphism, the fact that $(\Aut_\tau (G), \circ )$ is closed is clear. To conclude, as $f \in \Aut_\tau(G)$ is a homeomorphism, $f^{-1} \in \Aut_\tau(G)$. Furthermore, $e: (G, \tau) \rightarrow (G, \tau)$ given by $e(x) = x$ is a homeomorphism. So, $e \in \Aut_\tau(G)$. 
                \par By the subgroup test, 
                $$\Aut_\tau(G) \leq \Aut(G)$$
                \end{proof}
            
            \item Suppose that $(G, \tau, m)$ is a $T_2$, finite, topological group. We claim $\tau = \mathcal{P}(G)$: 
                \begin{proof} As $G$ is $T_2$, $\{x\}$ is open for each $x \in G$. Thus, as the union of open sets is open, it follows that $\tau = \mathcal{P}(G)$. 
                \end{proof}
                
            \item We claim that all topological groups of order $2$ are topologically isomorphic. 
                \begin{proof} Let $(G, \tau_G, m)$ be the topological group of order $2$. Consider the topological group $(Z_2, \tau_{Z_2}, +)$ and the map $\phi: G \rightarrow Z_2$, given by $\phi(e_G) = 0$, and $\phi(g) = 1$. The fact that $\phi$ is a group isomorphism is well-known. Further, $\phi$ is 1-1 and onto, and $\phi^{-1}$ is continuous, as $\tau_G = \mathcal{P}(G)$ and $\tau_{Z_2} = \mathcal{P}(Z_2)$. This concludes the proof. 
                \end{proof}
        \end{enumerate}
    
    
    \subsection{Homotopy Type}
        \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
        
            \item We prove that if $A$ is a subspace of a topological space $X$ and  $G: X \times I \rightarrow X$ is deformation retract relative to $A$, then $X$ and $A$ have the same homotopy type\footnote{Armstrong does not do a good job of defining a deformation retract. We use the following definition. "Strong" deformation retract: $A$ is a 'strong' deformation retract of $X$ iff there exists a map $D:X \times I \rightarrow X$ such that $D(a,t)=a$ for every $a \in A$, $D(x,0)=x$ and $D(x,1) \in A$ for all $x \in X$. See \href{http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/488527/deformation-retract-and-homotopy-equivalence}{this post on SE.}}: 
                \begin{proof} Indeed: Let $f:A \rightarrow X$ be the inclusion map and $g: X \rightarrow A$ be defined by $g(x) = G(x,1)$. We have previously shown that $f$ and $g$ are continuous. It is only left to show that $f \circ g \simeq 1_X$ and $g \circ f \simeq 1_A$:
                \par Direct computation shows that 
                    \begin{align*}
                        (g \circ f)(a) & = g(f(a)) = g(a) = G(a,1) = a,
                    \end{align*}
                while $f \circ g \simeq_G 1_X$. This completes the proof.
                \end{proof}
                
            \item We show that any non-empty convex subset, $X$, of a euclidean space is homotopy equivalent to a point: 
                \begin{proof} 
                Without loss of generality, we assume that $X \subset \E^n$. We first show the existence of a deformation retract, $G: X \times I \hookrightarrow \{x\}$, where $x \in X$ is fixed:
                \par Let $G$ be defined as $G(y,t) = (1-t)y + tx$, for all $y \in X$. Then, clearly $G(y,0) = y$, and $G(y,1) = x \in \{x\}$ for all $y \in X$. So, $G$ is deformation retract. By the above, $X$ and $A$ are of the same homotopy type: null-homotopic. 
                \end{proof}
 
            \item We show  that $(X, \tau)$ is contractible\footnote{A space $(X, \tau)$ is contractible (to a point $x_0 \in X$) provided that there exists a map $F: X \times I \rightarrow X$ such that $F(x, 0) = x$ and $F(x,1) = x_0$.} if, and only if, every map $f:X \rightarrow Y$, $(Y, \tau_Y)$ a topological space, is null-homotopic: 
                \begin{proof}
                $ $\newline
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item[] ($\implies$): Suppose that $(X, \tau)$ is contractible to $x_0 \in X$. Let $F$ be the contraction, and $f: X \rightarrow Y$ any map. The claim is that $f \circ F: X\times I \rightarrow Y$ is a homotopy between $f$, and $f(x_0)$. 
                        \par Indeed; We note that the composition of two continuous functions is continuous and 
                        $$(f \circ F)(x,0) = f(F(x,0)) = f(x)$$ As well as,  
                        $$(f \circ F)(x,1) = f(F(x,1)) = f(x_0)$$
                        
                        \item[] ($\impliedby$): Suppose that every map $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is null-homotopic. Then, in particular, $i:X \rightarrow X$ is null-homotopic. Thus, there exists a map $F:X \times I \rightarrow X$, such that $F(x,0) = x =i(x)$, and $F(x,1) = x_0 = i(x_0)$.
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{proof}
                
            \item Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space. We show that the cone on $X$, $CX$ is contractible. We consider the "cone tip" as $X \times \{0\}$:     \begin{proof} Consider the function $\bar{H}: (X \times I) \times I \rightarrow X \times I$, given by $\bar{H}((x,v),s) = (x,v(1-s))$. By the     product topology, it follows that $\bar{H}$ is continuous. \footnote{For every $t \in I$, we can associate $\pi(\bar{H}((x,v),t))$ with           $(c,v(1-t),t)$, showing that the product topology of $CX \times I$ agrees with that of $(X \times I) \times I$.} Let $\pi:X \times I            \rightarrow CX = \nicefrac{X \times I}{X \times \{0\}}$ be the canonical map. The claim is that $\pi \circ \bar{H}: (X \times I) \times I     \rightarrow CX$ is the desired homotopy.
                \par Direct computation shows that, for all $x \in X$, $v \in V$,
                $$\pi(\bar{H}( (x,v),0)) = \pi((x,v)) = (x,v),$$
                and 
                $$\pi(\bar{H}( (x,v),1)) = \pi((x,0)) = (x,0)$$
                Thus, $H \equiv \pi \circ \bar{H}$ is the desired homotopy. 
                \end{proof}

    \begin{enumerate}
    
        \item We prove that $v(T) - e(T) = 1$ for any tree $T$: 
            \begin{proof} We proceed by induction on the number of edges in $T$: 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Basis: If $e(T) =1$, then $v(T) = 2$, and so,  $v(T) - e(T) = 1$.
                    \item Hypothesis: Suppose that  $v(T) - e(T) = 1$ for any tree $T$, such that $e(T) = n$, for some $n \in \N$.
                    \item Step: Suppose that $T$ is a tree, such that $e(T) = n+1$. Now, removing any edge will disconnect the tree, since by definition, $T$ contains no loops. Say that we remove and edge $e_0 \in T$, breaking up $T$ into $T_1$, $T_2$. Now, clearly, $v(T) = v(T_1) + v(T_1)$, and $e(T) = n+1 = e(T_1) +e(T_2) +1$. Thus, by the inductive hypothesis,
                        \begin{align*}
                        v(T) - e(T) & = v(T_1) + v(T_2) - e(T_1) - e(T_2) - 1 \\
                        & = 1 + 1 - 1 \\
                        & = 1
                        \end{align*}
                \end{itemize}
            \end{proof}
        
         \item We show that inside any graph we can always find a tree which contains all the vertexes: 
            \begin{proof} Let $G$ be a finite graph. If $G$ is already a tree, we are done. So, suppose that $G$ is not a tree. Then, by the comments on pg. $3$, $G$ contains a (without loss of generality, minimal) loop, $L$. Now, we remove some edge $e_L \in L$. Now, as $L$ is a loop, $e_L$ does not disconnect $L$, and so $L - e_L$ is a tree. We continue in this way, as long as the new graph formed by removing an edge is not a tree.
            \par To conclude, we note that this process must stop at some loop, because $e(G) < \infty$; further, we have not removed any vertexes. 
            \end{proof}
        
        \item We prove that $v(\Gamma) - e(\Gamma) \leq 1$ for any graph $\Gamma$, with equality, precisely when $\Gamma$ is a tree: 
            \begin{proof} We have previously shown the equality condition. Using the above proof, we select a subtree, with the same vertexes as $\Gamma$. Call this tree $\Gamma'$. Then, $v(\Gamma') - e(\Gamma') = 1$. As $\Gamma'$ was created by removing edges, and not vertexes, we have $v(\Gamma) = v(\Gamma')$, and $e(\Gamma) \leq e(\Gamma')$. So, 
            $$e(\Gamma) - e(\Gamma) \leq v(\Gamma') - e(\Gamma') = 1$$
            \end{proof}
            
        \item This is left to the reader as an exercise.
        
        \item This is left to the reader as an exercise. 
        
        \item Let $P$ be a regular polyhedron in which each face has $p$ edges and for which $q$ faces meet at each vertex. We use Euler's formula to prove that,
        $$ \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{e} $$
            \begin{proof} We count the number of faces of $P$ as follows: Since each face of $P$ has $p$ edges, $pf = 2e$. We count the number of vertexes as follows: Since each vertex has $q$ faces which meet on it, $qv = 2e$. In all, $f = \nicefrac{2e}{p}$, and $v = \nicefrac{2e}{q}$. Assuming that Euler's formula holds for $P$, we have 
            $$v - e + f = \frac{2e}{q} - e + \frac{2e}{p} = 2$$
            And the result follows. 
            \end{proof}
            
        \item We deduce that there are only $5$ regular (convex) polyhedra. 
            \begin{proof} If $P$ is a polyhedra, it must satisfy the above criterion.Further, we assume that $p \geq 3$, since if not, we cannot construct a polygon. We use Shl{\"u}t notation. By checking routinley, for values up to $p,q \leq 5$ we have the following set of polyhedra: 
            $$\{ \{3,3\}, \{3,5\}, \{5,3\}, \{3,4\} , \{4,3\}\}$$
            \par Now, if $p \geq 6$, then we must have
            $$ \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{e}$$
            Further, as $0 \leq \nicefrac{1}{q} \leq \nicefrac{1}{5}$, we have 
                \begin{align*}
                    \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{q} & = \frac{q+6}{6q} \\
                    & < \frac{12}{6q} = \frac{2}{q} \\
                    & < \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{e}
                \end{align*}
            A contradiction.

        \item This is left to the reader as an exercise. 
        
        \item We find a homeomorphism from the real xline to the open interval $(0,1)$, and show that any two open intervals are homeomorphic:
            \begin{proof} We show that the real line, $\R$ is homeomorphic to $(\nicefrac{-\pi}{2}, \nicefrac{\pi}{2})$.This amount to showing that $arctan: \R \rightarrow (\nicefrac{-\pi}{2}, \nicefrac{\pi}{2})$ is continuous, 1-1, onto and that $tan \equiv arctan^{-1}$ is continuous. Thus, $\R \simeq (\nicefrac{-\pi}{2}, \nicefrac{\pi}{2})$.  
            \par To conclude the proof, we show that any open subset, $(a,b) \subset \R$ is homeomorphic to $(\nicefrac{-\pi}{2}, \nicefrac{\pi}{2})$, $a \neq b$:
            \par Indeed, under the mapping $f(x) = (b-a)(\frac{x}{\pi} +\frac{1}{2}) +a$, we have 
            $$(\nicefrac{-\pi}{2}, \nicefrac{\pi}{2}) \rightarrow (a,b)$$
            As $f$ is a degree $1$ polynomial in $\R$, it follows that it is 1-1, onto and continuous with a continuous inverse. 
            \end{proof}
        
        \item This is left to the reader as an exercise.
        
        \item We find a homeomorphism from $S^2 - N = S^2 - \{(0,0,1)\}$ to $\E^2$: 
            \begin{proof} As pointed out in Armstrong, we find a formula for stereographic projection. From the fact that $S^2 = \{x \in \R^3: ||x||_2 =1\}$, and rules of calculus, any line passing through $v = (x,y,z) \in S^2 - N$ and $N$ is of the following form: 
                \begin{equation}
                p(t) = (0,0,1) + t(x,y,z) \equiv <tx,ty,1-t(1-x)>    
                \end{equation}
            For $t \in [0, \infty)$. As the $z$ component of $p$ is zero exactly when $t_0 = \nicefrac{1}{1-z}$, we substitute $t_0$ back in $(1)$ to obtain our formula for stereographic projection: 
            \[\Pi (x,y,z) = \big(\frac{x}{1-z},\frac{y}{1-z} \big) \]
            It is left to show that $\Pi$ is 1-1, onto, continuous, with a continuous inverse. 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item[] 1-1: By component wise comparison, the result follows. 
                    \item[] Onto: Given $(x_0,y_0) \in \R^2$, we have, after some simple algebra, 
                            \[ \Pi \Big(\frac{x_0}{r}, \frac{y_0}{r}, \frac{x_0^2 + y_0^2}{r}\Big) = (x_0,y_0),\]
                            where $r = 1+x_0^2 +y_0^2$.  
                    \item[] Continuity: As $\Pi$ is a linear transformation in $\R^2$, we know that from rules of calculus/real analysis that it is continuous.
                    \item[] Cont. Inverse: $\Pi^{-1}$ is as outline above in the derivation of onto. For the same reasons the function is continuous. 
                \end{itemize}
            \end{proof}
            
        \item Let $x,y \in S^2$. We find a homeomorphism from $S^2$ to $S^2$ which takes $x$ to $y$. We do the same for the plane, and torus: 
            \begin{proof} We assume that results about matrix groups are applicable. 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item $S^2$: Consider $S^2$ and $SO(3)$. Let $x \in S^2$. Then, by the Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization process, there exists $X \in SO(3)$ for which $x$ is the first column of $X$. Likewise for $y$, its corresponding matrix $Y$. Then, $YX^{-1} \in SO(3)$ and maps $x$ to $y$. As $SO(3)$ is a group, $(YX^{-1})^{-1} \in SO(3)$. Thus, $YX^{-1}$ is a homeomorphism which takes $x$ to $y$.
                    
                    \item $\E^2$: Fix $(x,y),(z,w) \in \R^2$. Then, the function, $f$ that sends $(a,b) \in \R^2$ to \[((x+z)-a, (y+w)-b)\]
                    sends  $(x,y)$ to $(z,w)$. As $f$ is linear, it is continuous. Likewise, its inverse is continuous. 
                    
                    \item Torus: Consider the torus as $S^1 \times S^1$. Then component wise examination shows that the example above proves the result. 
                \end{itemize}
            \end{proof}

        \item Define $f:[0,1) \rightarrow C$, by $f(x) = e^{2\pi i x}$. We prove that $f$ is a continuous bijection. In addition, we find a point $x \in [0,1)$ and a neighbourhood $N$, of $x$ in $[0,1)$, such that $f[N]$ is not a neighbourhood of $f(x)$ in $C$; consequently, this means $f$ is not a homeomorphism. 
            \begin{proof} We first show that $f$ is a continuous bijection: 
            \par Via Euler's formula,
            \[ e^{2\pi i x} = cos(2\pi x) + i sin(2\pi x), \quad \forall x \in \R \]
            Using this fact, we show that $f$ is 1-1 and onto. 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item 1-1: Suppose that $cos(2\pi x) + i sin(2\pi x) = cos(2\pi y) + i sin(2\pi y)$ for some $x, y \in [0,1)$. Then, by component-wise comparison of complex numbers we have $cos(2\pi y) = cos(2\pi x)$, iff, $2 \pi y = 2\pi x$, iff $x = y$, as $x,y \in [0,1)$; likewise for $sin$. Thus, $f$ is 1-1. 
                    
                    \item Onto: Let $y \in C$. Then, $y = cos(2\pi y_0) + i sin(2\pi y_1)$ for some $(y_0, y_1) \in \R^2$. But as $f: [0,1) \rightarrow C$, we have $0 \leq 2 \pi y_0, 2\pi y_1 \leq 2\pi$. Consequently, $f$ is onto.
                    
                    \item Continuity: By the definition of continuity in $\mathbb{C}$, and the fact that $cos$, $sin$ are continuous, we have that $f$ is continuous. 
                \end{itemize}
            
            Next, consider $[0, 1/2) \subset [0,1)$. This is a open neighbourhood in $[0,1)$, by definition. But, $f[[0,1/2)]$ is $C$ intersected with the upper half of the plane minus $z = -1$. Which is not a neighbourhood of $z =1 \in C$, because any open ball centered around $z =1$ must contain the lower plane. Therefore, $f$ is not a homeomorphism. 
            \end{proof}

        \item We prove that the radial projection of the tetrahedron to the sphere is a homeomorphism: 
            \begin{proof} A solid proof of this relies on the fact that a circumscribed polygon with center of mass $0$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$ via radial projection. The result of which are shown in chapter $5$.

        %Let $\partial D = S^1 \subset \mathbb{C}$. Given two points $x,y \in \Int{D}$, we find a homeomorphism from $D$ to $D$ which interchanges $x$ and $y$ and leaves all the points of $C$ fixed:

        \item We show that if $A$ is a dense subset of a space $(X, \tau)$, and if ${\Ocal} \in \tau$, that ${\Ocal} \subset \overline{A \cap {\Ocal}}$:
            \begin{proof} Suppose, to the contrary, that ${\Ocal} \not\subset \overline{A \cap {\Ocal}}$. Then, there exist some $x \in {\Ocal}$, such that $x \notin \overline{A \cap {\Ocal}}$.
            \par As $\overline{A \cap {\Ocal}}$ is closed, $x \in (\overline{A \cap {\Ocal}})^c$ and so,  there exists some ${\Ocal}_x \in \tau$ such that $x \in {\Ocal}_x$, and 
            \[\overline{A \cap {\Ocal}} \cap (\underset{x}{\Ocal} - \{x\}) = \emptyset \]
            But, as $x \notin \overline{A \cap {\Ocal}}$, we have 
            \[ \overline{A \cap {\Ocal}} \cap {\Ocal}_x = \emptyset \]
            and consequently, $A \cap {\Ocal} \cap {\Ocal}_x = \emptyset$. But then, setting $B = {\Ocal} \cap {\Ocal}_x$, we have $x \in B$, $B \in \tau$, but $A \cap B = \emptyset$, contrary to extra lemma; $\bar{A} \neq X$, a contradiction. 
            \end{proof}
            
            
        \item This is left to the reader as an exercise.
        
        \item Suppose that $Y$ is a subspace of $(X, \tau)$. We show that a subset $A$ of $Y$ is closed in $Y$ if it is the intersection of $Y$ with a closed set in $X$. Further, we show that we get the same result if we take the closer in $Y$ or $X$: 
            \begin{proof} If $A \subset Y$ is closed in $Y$, then $Y - A$ is open in $Y$. But then, by the definition of subspace topology, $Y - A = Y \cap {\Ocal}_y$, for some open ${\Ocal}_y \in X$. Consequently, we have 
                \begin{align*}
                    A & = Y - (Y \cap {\Ocal}_y) \\
                    & = Y \cap (Y \cap {\Ocal}_y)^c \\
                    & = Y \cap (X - {\Ocal}_y)
                \end{align*}
            And, as $X - {\Ocal}_y$ is closed in $X$, this proves the result. We note that a similar case holds in the case where $A$ is open.
            \par Letting $\bar{A_y}$ and $\bar{A_x}$ denote the closure of $A \subset Y$ in $Y$ and $X$ respectively, we show that  $\bar{A_y} = \bar{A_x}$: 
            \newline \par  From the previous part of this proof, we have that $\bar{A_y} = Y \cap C$, where $C$ is closed in $X$. Now, since $C$ is a closed set in $X$ containing $A$, we have $\bar{A_x} \subset C$, and so $Y \cap \bar{A_x} \subset \bar{A_y} = Y \cap C$. 
            \par Again by the first problem, we have $Y \cap \bar{A_x}$ is closed in $Y$ and contains $A$. So, 
            \[ \bar{A_y} \subset Y \cap \bar{A_x} \subset \bar{A_x}\]
            Thus, $\bar{A_y} = \bar{A_x}$. 
            \end{proof}
            
        \item Let $Y$ be a subspace of $(X, \tau)$. Given $A \subset Y$, we show that $A_X^\circ \subset A_Y^\circ$, and give an example when the two may not be equal: 
            \begin{proof} Let $x \in A_x^\circ$. Then, there exists and open ${\Ocal}_x \subset X$, with $x \in {\Ocal}_x$ and ${\Ocal}_x \subset A$. Now, since ${\Ocal}_x \subset A \subset Y$, $x \in {\Ocal}_x \cap Y \subset A$ and, ${\Ocal}_x \cap Y$ is open in $Y$, by definition. Thus, $x \in A_y^\circ$. 
            \par An example when they might not be equal is in the following case: Let $X = \R$, $Y = \mathbb{Z}$, and $A = \{0\}$. Then, $A_x^\circ = \emptyset$. But, every point of $\mathbb{Z}$ is open in the subspace topology, and so $A_y^\circ = \{ 0\}$. 
            \end{proof}
            
        \item This is left to the reader as an exercise. However, here is a counter example to this exercise: 
        
        \item We show that the frontier of a set always contains the frontier of its interior, and describe the relationship between $\Ft (A \cup B)$ and $\Ft A$, $\Ft B$: 
            \begin{proof} Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space, and let $A \subset X$. We want to show that $\Ft A^\circ \subset \Ft A$. 
            \par Let $x \in \Ft A^\circ$. Then, 
            \[ x \in \bar{A^\circ} \cap \overline{(X - A^\circ)} = \bar{A^\circ} \cup \overline{(X-A) \cup (A - A^\circ)}\]
            Now, if $x \in \bar{A^\circ}$ and $x \in \overline{X -A}$, we are done. So suppose that $x \in \bar{A^\circ}$ and $x \in \overline{(A - A^\circ)}$. But then, $x \in \bar{A^\circ} \cup \overline{(A - A^\circ)} = \bar{A}$. Thus, the result follows.
            \newline \par 
            The inclusion $\Ft (A \cup B) \subset \Ft A \cup \Ft B$ always holds, and is left to the reader. To show that the reverse inclusion does not always hold, consider $X = \R$, and $A = \mathbb{Q}$. Then,
                \begin{align*}
                    \Ft (A \cup A^c) & = \Ft \R = \emptyset \\
                    & \neq \Ft A \cup \Ft A^c  = \R 
                \end{align*}
            \end{proof}
            
        \item This main part of this exercise is left to the reader. However, we do show that this topology does not have a countable base: 
            \begin{proof} Let $B = \tau$ be the topology specified. Suppose, to the contrary, that $\{B_n\}_{n = 1}^\infty$ is a countable base for the topology $\tau$. Define the function $f: \R \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ as follows: for each $x \in \R$, let $f(x) = n$, such that $B_n \subset [x,1+x)$. Now, we show that $f$ is 1-1 to arrive at a contradiction: 
            \par Indeed; Suppose to the contrary, without loss of generality, that $x < y$. Then, if $f(x) = f(y)$, $f(x) = [x, x+1) \subset B_{f(y)} = [y, y+1)$, which is impossible. Thus, $x = y$. 
            \end{proof}
            
        \item We show that if a topological space $(X, \tau)$ has a countable base for its topology, then $X$ contains a countable dense subset. I.e. A second countable space is separable: 
            \begin{proof} Let $\{B_n\}_n$ be a countable base for $\tau$. By the Axiom of Choice, let $A$ be the collection of elements $\{a_i\}_i$ such that $a_i \in B_i$. The claim is that $\bar{A} = X$. 
            \par Indeed; let ${\Ocal} \in \tau$. Then, ${\Ocal} = \bigcup_j B_j$, where $B_j \in B$. Now, as $A = \bigcup_i x_i$, where $x_i \in B_i$, we have $A \cap {\Ocal} \neq \emptyset$. Thus, by extra lemma, $\bar{A} = X$. 
            \end{proof}
            
    \end{enumerate}
        
    
    \subsection{Continuous Functions}
        \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
            \item We show that if $f: \R \rightarrow \R$ is a map, then the set of points left fixed by $f$ is closed. Further, the kernel of $f$ is closed.
                \begin{proof} Define $f_0(x) = f(x) - x$. The rest is left to the reader. 
                \end{proof}
                
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise.
            
            \item Let $f: \E \rightarrow \R$ be a map and define $\Gamma_f: \E \rightarrow \E^2$ by $\Gamma_f (x) = (x, f(x))$. Whe show that $\Gamma _f$ is continuous and that its image, with the induced topology, is homeomorphic to $\E$: 
                \begin{proof} We show that $\Gamma_f$ is continuous. To do this, we use the sequential criterion for continuity in $\E^n$. Let $\{x_n\}_n$ be a sequence in $\E$, such that $x_n \rightarrow x \in \E$. Then $\Gamma_f$ is clearly continuous by the fact that $f$ is, and component wise comparison.  That is, 
                \[  \Gamma_f (x_n) = (x_n, f(x_n)) \rightarrow (x, f(x)) = \Gamma_f (x) \]
                Next, we show that $\Image \Gamma_f$ is homeomorphic to $\E$:
                \par We claim that the function $p_1: \Image \Gamma_f \rightarrow \E$, defined by $p_1((x, f(x)) = x$ is the desired homeomorphism. 
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item[] Continuity: We have previously shown that the projection map is continuous.
                        \item[] 1-1: This is true, by construction. 
                        \item[] Onto: This is clear, as $f$ a map from $\E$ to $\E$. 
                        \item[] Cont. Inverse: This is clear, as $p_1^{-1} \equiv \Gamma_f$, and we have shown $\Gamma_f$ is continuous. 
                    \end{itemize}
                This proves the result.\footnote{A similar argument applies to $\E^n$.} 
                \end{proof}
                
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise. Hint: Show that the discrete topology is the smallest topology on $X$ for which this is the case. 
            
            \item Consider $X = \R$ with the co-finite topology, $(\R, CO)$. We show that $f: \E \rightarrow  X$ defined by $f(x) = x$ is a map, but not a homeomorphism: 
                \begin{proof} To see that $f$ is continuous, let ${\Ocal} \in CO$. Then, $X - {\Ocal} = \R - {\Ocal}$ is finite. But then, $f^{-1}[{\Ocal}] = {\Ocal}$, and ${\Ocal}^c$ is finite in $\E$. This implies that ${\Ocal} = \bar{{\Ocal}}$. Thus, ${\Ocal}^c = {\Ocal}$ is open in $\E$. The fact that $f$ is 1-1 is clear. 
                \par Consider the inverse function of $f$. Note that $(a,b)$, $a < b$ is open in $\E$. But, $f^{-1}[(a,b)] = (a,b) = f[(a,b)]$, which is not open in $X$. Thus, $f^{-1}$ is not continuous.
                \end{proof}
                
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise.
            
            \item Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space, $A \subset X$, and $\chi_A$ its characteristic function. We describe the frontier of $A$ in terms of $\chi$: 
                \begin{proof} We note that if $\overline{(X -A)} \cap \bar{A} \neq \emptyset$, then there exists $a \in \overline{(X -A)}$, $a \in \bar{A}$. With this in mind, we claim that $\chi_A$ is continuous at $a \in X$ if, and only if, $a \notin \Ft A$. 
                \par Indeed; 
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item[] ($\implies$): Suppose, to the contrary, that $\chi_A$ is continuous at $a \in X$, but that $a \in \Ft A$. Then, $a \in \overline{X-A}$, and $a \in \bar{A}$. Now, let ${\Ocal} = (.99, 1.99) \subset \R$, without loss of generality. Then, $\chi_A(a) = 1 \in {\Ocal}$. Now, since $\chi_A$ is continuous, $\chi_A^{-1} [{\Ocal}]$ is open, and such that $a \in \chi_A^{-1} [{\Ocal}]$. But then, $\overline{X-A} \cap \chi_A^{-1} [{\Ocal}] \neq \emptyset$. Further, this implies that $X-A \cap \chi_A^{-1} [{\Ocal}] \neq \emptyset$. But then, $\chi_A(a) = 0 \in {\Ocal}$, a contradiction. 
                        \item[] ($\impliedby$): 
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{proof}
                
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise.
            
            \item See section section 1. 
            
        \end{enumerate}
        
        
        
    \subsection{Space-Filling Curves}
        \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
            \item We find a Peano curve which fills out the unit square in $\E^2$: 
                \begin{proof} We apply lemma $2.10$. By a previous exercise, we have that $\partial [0,1]^2$ is homeomorphic to $\partial S^1$. Further, the boundary of the unit triangle is homeomorphic to $\partial S^1$. Therefore, by lemma $2.10$, there is a homeomorphism, $f$, from the unit triangle to the unit disc. Let $h: [0,1] \rightarrow T$ be the space filling curve of the triangle as mentioned in Armstrong. Then, $f \circ h$ is a continuous mapping from $[0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]^2$. Further, it is space filling. 
                \end{proof}
                
            \item We find an onto, continuous function from $[0,1]$ to $S^2$: 
                \begin{proof} From a previous exercise, we have that $\E^2 \cong_f (0,1) \times (0,1)$. Further, we have shown that $\E^2 \cong_\pi S^2 - (0,0,1)$. Thus, we extend $f$ to $g: [0,1]^2 \rightarrow S^2$ by 
                \[g(x) = 
                    \begin{cases}
                    f(x) & x \notin \partial [0,1]^2 \\
                    (0,0,1) & x \in \partial [0,1]^2
                    \end{cases}
                \]
                Then, if ${\Ocal} \subset S^2$ is open, and contains $(0,0,1)$, then $g^{-1}[{\Ocal}]$ is the entire square via homeomorphism. Now, if ${\Ocal} \subset S^2$ does not contain $(0,0,1)$ and is open, then $g^{-1}[{\Ocal}] = f^{-1}[{\Ocal}]$ which is clearly open. 
                \par
                Thus, $g \circ h$, where $h$ is the triangle space-filling curve, is the desired function.
                \end{proof}
                
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise. Hint: Use the fact that $[0,1]$ is compact. 
            
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise. Hint: Use component wise definitions. 
            
            \item To proved a rigorous proof of this, at this point, is out of the question. However, via theorems 3.3, and 3.7, it is not true. 
            
        \end{enumerate}
    
    \subsection{The Tietze Extension Theorem}
    Throughout these exercises, we assume that $(X, d)$ is a metric space, and that if $A \subset X$, it has the subspace metric. Further, the topology on $X$ is the induced topology, if not stated otherwise. 
        \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
            \item We show that $d(x,A) = 0$, if, and only if, $x \in \bar{A}$:
                \begin{proof} $ $\newline
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item[] Suppose that $d(x,A) = 0 = \inf_{a \in A} d(x,a)$. Then, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $a \in A$, such that 
                        \[|d(x,a) - 0| = d(x,a) < \epsilon \]
                        Now, let ${\Ocal}$ be an open subset of $X$, $x \in {\Ocal}$. Choose $a \in A$ such that, $d(x,a) < \epsilon$. Then, $a \in {\Ocal}$, and ${\Ocal} \cap A \neq \emptyset$. Thus, $x \in \bar{A}$. 
                        
                        \item[] Suppose that $x \in \bar{A}$. Then, we do the canonical ball construction and pick a sequence $\{a_n\}_n$ of elements of $A$, such that $d(x, a_n) \rightarrow 0$, $n \rightarrow \infty$. 
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{proof}
                
            \item We show that if $A,B \subset X$ are disjoint and closed, there exists disjoint open sets $U,V$ such that $A \subset U$ and $B \subset V$:
                \begin{proof} By lemma $2.13$, there exists a continuous function $f: X \rightarrow [-1,1]$, such that $f[A] \equiv 1$, and $f[B] \equiv -1$. Let $O_1 = [-1,0]$, and $O_2 = [0,1]$. Then, $O_1, O_2$ are open in $[-1,1]$. Thus, $f^{-1}[O_i]$ is open, as $f$ is continuous. Further, $f^{-1}[O_1] \cap f^{-1}[O_2] = \emptyset$, and $A \subset f^{-1}[O_1]$, $B \subset f^{-1}[O_2]$. 
                \end{proof}
                
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise.
                
            \item We show that every closed subset of a metric space is the intersection of a countable number of open sets: 
                \begin{proof} Let $A$ be a closed subset of $X$. Define 
                \[A_n = \{x \in X : d(x,A) < \frac{1}{n} \}\]
                Then, $A_n$ is open, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The claim is that $\bigcap_n A_n = A$: 
                \newline
                \par Clearly, $A \subset A_n$, for each $n$ so, $A \subset \bigcap_n A_n$. Next, suppose that $x \in \bigcap_n A_n$, but $x \notin A$. Then, 
                \[1 > \inf_{a \in \bigcap_n A_n} d(x,a) = \epsilon > 0\]
                By the Archimedian Principal, there exists $n_0$ large enough so that $\nicefrac{1}{n_0} < \epsilon $. But then, 
                \[x \notin \bigcap_n A_n\]
                Thus, $\bigcap_n A_n \subset A$. 
                \par This concludes the proof. 
                \end{proof}
                
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise.
            
            \item We show that if $A$ is a closed subset of $X$, then any map $f: A \rightarrow \E^n$ can be extended over $X$: 
                \begin{proof} The is the Tietze extension theorem applied component-wise. 
                \end{proof}

    \subsection{Closed and Bounded Subsets of $\E^n$}
    There are not exercises for this section. 
    
    \subsection{The Heine-Borel Theorem}
        \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise.
            
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise.
            
            \item We use the Heine-Borel theorem to show that an infinite subset of a closed interval must have a limit point: 
                \begin{proof} By 'infinite', we assume that the author means that the cardinality of the set is non-finite and countable. We proceed by contradiction: 
                \par Let $C$ be the closed interval. Suppose that such an infinite subset, $A$, of $C$ does not have any limit points. Then, for each $x \in C$, there is an open set ${\Ocal}_x$ in $C$, such that $x \in {\Ocal}_x$ and ${\Ocal}_x \cap (A - \{x\}) = \emptyset$. In addition, 
                \[C \subset \bigcup_{x \in C} {\Ocal}_x \]
                So, $\bigcup_{x \in C} {\Ocal}_x$ is an open cover of $C$, and consequently, has a finite subcover: 
                \[\mathcal{F} = \bigcup_{\substack{x_i  \\ i \in \{1,2, ..., N\}}} {\Ocal}_{x_i}\]
                Then, $A \subset \mathcal{F}$ and ${\Ocal}_{x_i} \cap A = x_i$ for each $i$. Thus, 
                \[A = \mathcal{F} \cap A = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_N\}\]
                A contradiction. 
                \end{proof}
                
            \item We rephrase the definition of compactness in terms of closed sets:\footnote{Definition; The finite intersection propert (FIP): Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a collection of sets. Then, $\mathcal{F}$ has the finite intersection property if whenever $F_1, F_2, ..., F_n \in \mathcal{F}$, $F_1 \cap F_2 \cap ... \cap F_n \neq \emptyset$.} 
                \begin{proof} We claim that $X$ is compact if, and only if, for every collection $\{C_i\}_{i \in I}$ of closed sets in $X$ with the FIP, $\bigcap_i C_i \neq \emptyset$. 
                Indeed:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item[] ($\implies$) We proceed by contradiction: Let $X$ be compact, and let $\{C_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a collection of closed sets with the FIP, such that, $\bigcap_i C_i = \emptyset$. 
                        \par Then, by De-Morgan's Laws, as $C_i^c$ is open, 
                        \[\bigcup_i C_i^c = \Big( \bigcap_i C_i \Big)^c = \emptyset^c = X\]
                        Thus, there exists a finite subcover, 
                        \[\{C_{i_1}^c, C_{i_2}^c, ..., C_{i_n}^c\},\]
                        with $X = \bigcup_k C_{i_k}^c$. And, so, 
                        \[X^c = \emptyset = \Big(\bigcup_k C_{i_k}^c\Big)^c = \bigcap_k C_{i_k} \neq \emptyset\]
                        However, this is clearly a contradiction. Thus, $\bigcap_i C_i \neq \emptyset$. 
                        
                        \item[] ($\impliedby$) Let $\mathcal{F} = \{ {\Ocal}_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an open cover of $X$. Then, $\{{\Ocal}_i^c\}_{i \in I}$ is a collection of closed sets, such that 
                        \[\bigcap_i {{\Ocal}}_i^c = \Big( \bigcup_i {\Ocal}_i \Big)^c = X^c = \emptyset\]
                        Thus, there exists a finite set $\{{\Ocal}_1^c, {\Ocal}_2^c, ..., {\Ocal}_n^c\}$, such that 
                        $$\bigcap_{k = 1,2, ... , n} {\Ocal}_k^c = \emptyset $$ 
                        \par But then, 
                        \[\Big(\bigcap_{k = 1,2, ... , n} {\Ocal}_k^c\Big)^c = \bigcup_{k = 1,2, ... , n} {\Ocal}_k = (X^c)^c = X\]
                        So, $\mathcal{F}$ contains a finite subcover. 
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{proof}

            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise. Hint: Consider $\R$, and $\R$, with the discrete and indiscreet topologies. 
            
            \item We show that Lebesgue's Lemma fails for $\E^2$: 
                \begin{proof}Let $B(0,1)$ be the open ball of radius one, centered around the origin. And, for each $p \neq 0$ in $\E^2$, let $B(p, \nicefrac{1}{||p||_2})$ be the open ball centered at $p$ and radius $\nicefrac{1}{||p||_2}$. Now, let $\delta > 0$, and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be such that 
                \[\frac{1}{n} < \frac{\delta}{3}\]
                Then, the open ball of radius $\nicefrac{2 \delta}{3}$ around the point $(n,0)$ is not contained in any $B(p, \nicefrac{1}{||p||_2})$. 
                \end{proof}
                
            \item \textit{Lindel{\"o}f's Theorem}: We show that if $X$ has a countable base for its topology, $\tau$, then any open cover of $X$ contains a countable subcover: 
                \begin{proof}
                \end{proof}
                
            \item This is show by extra lemma, and the fact that compact subsets of $T_2$ spaces are closed.
            
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise. Hint: These are a direct application of the exercises found in the book. 
            
            \item We find an example of a topological space $(X, \tau)$ and a compact subset whose closure is not compact: 
                \begin{proof} Consider $\R = X$, and $\tau = \{\R, \emptyset, (-a,a) : a > 0\}$. Then, $\{0\}$ is clearly compact in $X$, and it is closed. But, $\overline{\{0\}} = \R$ as each $(-a, a)^c = (-\infty, -a] \cup [a, \infty)$ and $0 \notin (-\infty, -a] \cup [a, \infty)$. 
                \end{proof}
                
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise.
            
            \item Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be a closed map such that $f^{-1}(y)$, $y \in Y$ is a compact subset of $X$. We show that $f^{-1}[K]$ is compact whenever $K$ is compact in $Y$: 
                \begin{proof} This follows from the fact that 
                \[f^{-1}[K] = f^{-1}[\bigcup_{k \in K} \{k\}] = \bigcup_{k \in K} f^{-1}[\{k\}]\]
                and the fact that the union of finite sets is finite. 
                \end{proof}
                
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise. Hint: Use the fact that a compact $T_2$ space is $T_3$, $T_4$ and theorem 3.7. 
            
            \item The proof of the first part is left to the reader. However, we show that any closed subset of a locally compact space is locally compact, $\mathbb{Q}$ is not locally compact,and that local compactness is preserved under homeomorphism: 
                \begin{proof}
                \end{proof}
                
            \item Suppose that $X$ is locally compact and Hausdorff. Given $x \in X$, and a neighbourhood $\Ocal$ of $x$, we find a compact neighbourhood $K$ of $x$ which is contained in $\Ocal$:  
                \begin{proof} Let $\Ocal$ be as given. Then, since $X$ is locally compact, there exists a compact neighbourhood $V$, such that $x \in V$. By the subspace topology, it follows that $x \in V \cap \Ocal$ and $\Ocal \cap V$ is open in $V$. Further, as $V$ is compact, it is closed, by theorem 3.6. 
                \end{proof}
                
            \item This is left to the reader as an exercise.
            
            \item We prove that $\E^n \cup \{\infty \}$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$:
                \begin{proof}
                \end{proof}
                
            \item Let $X$, and $Y$ be locally compact Hausdorff spaces, and let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be an onto map. We show that $f$ extends to a map from $X \cup \{\infty\}$ onto $Y \cup \{\infty\}$, if and only if, $f^{-1}[K]$ is compact for each compact subset $K$ of $Y$. Further, we deduce that if $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic spaces, then so are their one-point compactifications and find two spaces which are not homeomorphic, but have homeomorphic one-point compactifications:

\section{Homotopy Type}
\par Throughout this section, $\simeq$ will typically denote homotopy equivalence.
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
        \item If $X \simeq Y$ and $X' \simeq Y'$, we show that $X \times X' \simeq Y \times Y'$: 
            \begin{proof} We are given maps $f: X \rightarrow Y$, $g: Y \rightarrow X$, $f':X' \rightarrow Y'$ and $g': Y' \rightarrow X'$, such that $g \circ f \simeq_{\gamma'} 1_X$, $f \circ g \simeq_{\gamma} 1_Y$, $g' \circ f' \simeq_{\delta '} 1_{X'}$ and $f' \circ g' \simeq_{\delta} 1_{Y'}$. 
            \par From the component-wise definition of the product topology, $F: X \times X' \rightarrow Y \times Y'$, defined by $F(x,x') = (f(x), f'(x'))$, and $G: Y \times Y' \rightarrow X \times X'$, defined by $G(y,y') = (g(y), g'(y'))$ are continuous. Further, $F \circ G \simeq 1_{Y \times Y'}$, and $G \circ F \simeq 1_{X \times X'}$, via the canonical maps, component-wise defined: $\mathcal{F}:(X \times X') \times I \rightarrow X \times X'$, $\mathcal{F} \equiv (\gamma', \delta')$, and $\mathcal{G}:(Y \times Y') \times I \rightarrow Y \times Y'$, $\mathcal{G} \equiv (\gamma, \delta)$, respectively. 
            \par Thus, $X \times X' \simeq Y \times Y'$.
            \end{proof}
            
        \item We show that the cone, $CX$, is contractible for any space $(X, \tau_X)$:\footnote{We proved another proof for this. The first of which is in the extra lemmas section.}
            \begin{proof} By definition, we have $CX = \nicefrac{X \times I}{X\times \{1\}}$. Define ${H}: CX \times I \rightarrow CX$ by $${H}((x,t),s) = (x, t(1-s))$$ Then, we have 
                \begin{align*}
                    {H}((x,t), 0) & = (x,t) = 1_{CX} \\
                    {H}((x,t),1) & = (x,0) 
                \end{align*}
            Now, if ${\Ocal}_{CX} \in \tau_{CX}$, then $H^{-1}({\Ocal}_{CX}) = ({\Ocal}_{CX}, I) \in  CX \times I$. Thus, $H$ is continuous. This proves the result. 
            \end{proof}
    
        \item We show that the punctured torus deformation retracts onto the one-point union of two circles. 
            \begin{proof} We consider the torus as the identification space of a square, $X$, bounded by the box whose edge points are $(-1,-1),(-1,1),(1,1),(1,-1)$. Assume, without loss of generality, that the point $(0,0)$ is removed. 
            \par We show that $F:T \times I \rightarrow T$ defined by 
            $$F(x,t) = (1-t)x + t\frac{x}{||x||}$$
            is a deformation retract onto the one point union of two circles: 
            \par As
                \begin{align*}
                    F(x,0) & = x \\
                    F(x,1) & = \frac{x}{||x||} 
                \end{align*}
            $F$ is a deformation retract onto $\partial X$. The function $f: \partial X \rightarrow S_1^1 \bigvee S_2^1$, given by 
            \[f(x) = 
                \begin{cases}
                    g(x) & x \in (-1,\pm1)t + (1,\pm1)(1-t) \\
                    s(x) & x \in (\pm1,1)t + (\pm,-1)(1-t)
                \end{cases}
                \]
            for all $t \in I$, where $g,s$ are the guaranteed homeomorphisms from $[a,b]$ to $S^1$, is a homeomorphism by the Gluing Lemma. 
            \end{proof}
        
        \item For each of the following cases, we choose as base point in $C$ and describe the generators for the fundamental groups of $C$ and $S$. Further, we write down the homomorphism, in terms of these generators, the fundamental groups induced by the inclusion of $C$ in $S$. 
        \par Consider the following examples of a circle $C$ embedded in a surface $S$: 
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item $S = \text{M{\"o}bius Strip}$ and $C = \partial S$: 
                \item $S = S^1 \times S^1 = T^1$ and $C = \{(x.y) \in T^1 : x = y\}$:
                \item $S = S^1 \times I$ and $C = S^1 \times 1$:
            \end{enumerate}
            
        \item Suppose that $f,g: S^1 \rightarrow X$ are homotopic maps. We prove that the spaces formed from $X$ by attaching a disc, using $f$ and using $g$ are homotopy equivalent; in other words, we prove that $X \cup_f D \simeq X \cup_g D$: 
            \begin{proof} We aim to find maps $r,s'$, such that $r: X \cup_f D \rightarrow X \cup_g D$, $s: X \cup_g D \rightarrow X \cup_f D$, $s \circ r \simeq 1_{X \cup_f D}$ and  $r \circ s \simeq 1_{X \cup_g D}$. We note that 
            $$\nicefrac{X \sqcup D}{f(A) \sim A} = X \cup_f D, \quad  \nicefrac{X \sqcup D}{g(A) \sim A} =X \cup_g D $$
            \par As $f \simeq_F g$, $F$ is a map such that $F:S^1 \times I \rightarrow X$, and $F(x,0) = f(x)$, as well as, $F(x,1) = g(x)$. Using $F$, we construct the function $r:X \cup_f D \rightarrow X \cup_g D$ as follows: 
            \[ r(x) = 
                \begin{cases}
                    \{x, F(x,1)\} & x \in \{x, f(x)\} \\ 
                    x & \text{otherwise}\\
                \end{cases}
            \]
            Similarly, define $s: X \cup_g D \rightarrow X \cup_f D$ by
            \[ r(x) = 
                \begin{cases}
                    \{x, F(x,0)\} & x \in \{x, f(x)\} \\ 
                    x & \text{otherwise}\\
                \end{cases}
            \]
            
            \end{proof}
        
        \item We use the previous problem, and the third example of homotopy given in section $5.1$, to show that the 'dunce hat' has the homotopy type of a disc, and is therefore contractible: 
        
        \item We show that the 'house with two rooms' is contractible: 
        
        \item We give a detailed proof to show that the cylinder and the M{\"o}bius strip have the homotopy type of the circle: 
        
        \item Let $X$ be the comb space. We prove that the identity map of $X$ is not homotopic $\text{rel} \{p\}$, to the constant map, $p$. 
        
        \item \textit{FTA}: We prove the fundamental theorem of algebra: 
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem}
\par Throughout, we say a topological space $(X, \tau_X)$ has the fixed-point property if every continuous function from $X$ to itself has a fixed point. 

    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
        \item We determine which of the following have the fixed point property: 
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The $2$-Sphere: $S^2$ does not exhibit the fixed point property. 
                    \begin{proof}
                    We have previously shown that the map $f:S^n \rightarrow S^n$, given by $f(x) = -x$ is a homeomorphism.
                    \end{proof}
                    
                \item The Torus: $T^1 = S^1 \times S^1$ does not exhibit the fixed point property. 
                    \begin{proof}
                    As $T^1 = S^1 \times S^1$, and the antipodal map, $f$, on $S^1$ is a homeomorphism, we have that $F: T^1 \rightarrow T^1$, defined by $F((x,y)) = (f(x),f(y))$, is continuous and doesn't exhibit the fixed point property. 
                    \end{proof}
                    
                \item The interior of the unit disc: $\text{Int}D^1$ does not exhibit the fixed point property: 
                    \begin{proof} Note that the interior of the unit disc is homeomorphic to the euclidean plane by a homeomorphism $h: \text{Int}D^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{E}^2$. We define a function $g$ from the euclidean plane to the euclidean plane by $g((x,y))=(x+1,y)$. Then, $h^{-1}\circ g\circ h$ is a continuous function from the disc to itself that has no fixed point.
                    \end{proof}
                    
                \item The one point union of two circles: $X \vee Y = \nicefrac{ X  \amalg Y }{\{p\}}$ does not exhibit the fixed point property: 
                    \begin{proof} Define a function $f$ as follows: If $x\in X$ then we map $e^{ix}$ to $e^{i(x+\pi)}$. Also if $y \in Y$, we map $y$ to $f(p)=e^{\nicefrac{i\pi}{2}}$. This function $f$, as defined on the one point union, leaves no points fixed.
                    \end{proof}
            \end{enumerate}
            
        \item Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are of the same homotopy type and $X$ has the fixed-point property. We prove that $Y$ does not necessarily have the fixed point property: 
            \begin{proof} Let $Y$ be the subspace $(0,1) \subset \E^n$, and let $X = \{1/2\}$. Note that $Y$ is homotopic to $X$ by the straight line homotopy, and every map from $X$ to itself has a fixed point. Yet, the function $f: Y \rightarrow Y$, defined by $f(y)=y^2$ has no fixed point. 
            \end{proof}
            
        \item Suppose that $X$ retracts onto the subspace $A \subset X$, and that $A$ has the fixed point property. We show that $X$ may not exhibit the fixed point property: 
            \begin{proof} Take $X$ and $Y$, as above. The straight-line homotopy proves the assertion. 
            \end{proof}
        
        
        \item We show that if $X$ retracts onto the subspace $A$, and $X$ has the fixed-point property, then $A$ also has it: 
            \begin{proof} Let $f:A\rightarrow X$ be a continuous function. Since $X$ retracts onto $A$, there exists a map $g:X\rightarrow A$ such that $g \restriction{A} \equiv 1_A$. Then, $f \circ g$ is a continuous function from $X$ to $X$, and so has a fixed point. Hence, there exists an $a\in A$ such that $f(g(a))=f(a)=a$. This completes the proof. 
            \end{proof}
            
        \item We deduce that the fixed-point property holds for the 'house with two rooms', $X$: 
            \begin{proof} As was previously show, $X$ is contractible to some $x_0$. Thus, there exists some map $F: X \times I \rightarrow X$ such that $F(x,0) = x$, and $F(x,1) = x_0$. Thus, by extra lemma \footnote{include this}, every map $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is null-homotopic. In particular, this includes that maps $g: X \rightarrow X$. Thus, $X$ has the fixed point property\footnote{If this is not totally clear, see extra lemma.}. 
            \par To use the previous problems hints, we could think about starting with the unit cylinder, and pushing in the areas from the top and bottom. However, this method is not rigorous. 
            \end{proof}
            
        \item Let $f$ be a fixed-point-free map from a compact metric space $(X,d)$ to itself. We prove there is a positive number $\epsilon$ such that $d(x,f(x)) > \epsilon$, $\forall x\in X$: 
            \begin{proof} We show the contrapositive; Suppose that for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists an element $x \in X$ such that $d(x,f(x)) \leq \epsilon$. Pick $x_1\in X$ such that $d(x_1,f(x)) \leq \frac{1}{2} < 1$.
            \par It follows that there exists a set, $\{x_1,...,x_n\}\subset X$ such that $d(x_i,f(x_i)) <d(x_k,f(x_k))$, where $i<k$ and $d(x_k,f(x_k))<\dfrac{1}{k}$, for all $1\leq k\leq n$.
            \par Now, let 
            $$\epsilon_0 = \dfrac{1}{2}\min \Big\{d(x_1,f(x_1)),...,d(x_n,f(x_n),\frac{1}{n+1}\Big\}$$
            Then there exists an element $x\in X$ such that $d(x,f(x))\leq\epsilon_0$. Pick $x\in X$ that satisfies this property, and call this $x_{n+1}$. Note here that $d(x_n,f(x_n)) < d(x_{n+1},f(x_{n+1}))$ by construction. So that for all $i<n+1$, $d(x_i,f(x_i))\leq d(x_n,f(x_n))< d(x_{n+1},f(x_{n+1}))$. Thus by induction, we have created an infinite sequence $\{x_n\}_{n = 1}^\infty$ of distinct points such that $d(x_k,f(x_k))<\nicefrac{1}{k}$ for each positive integer $k$. And, $\{d(x_n,f(x_n))\}_n$ is a monotone decreasing sequence.
            \par Since $X$ is compact, every infinite subset has a limit point. Therefore $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty $ has a limit point $x \in X$. 
            \par Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Since $f$ is continuous at $x$, then there exists a $\delta >0$ such that $d(x,a)<\delta\implies d(f(x),f(a)<\nicefrac{\epsilon}{3}$ for all $a\in X$. By the Archimedian Property, we can find a positive integer $k$, such that 
            $$\frac{1}{k}<\frac{\epsilon}{3}$$
            Set $r= \min\{\dfrac{\epsilon}{3},\delta\}$. Then, since $x$ is a limit point of $\{x_n\}_{n = 1}^\infty$, there are infinitely many points of the sequence, such that $d(x_N,x)<r$. Thus, there exists a point $x_N$ such that $N>k$ and $d(x_N,x)<r$. Since $d(x_N,x)<\delta$, then $d(f(x_N),f(x))<\nicefrac{\epsilon}{3}$. Since $N>k$,  $$d(x_N,f(x_N)) < d(x_k,f(x_k)) < \nicefrac{1}{k} < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$$
            Therefore $$d(x,f(x))\leq d(x,x_N)+d(x_N,f(x_N))+d(f(x_N),f(x))<\frac{\epsilon}{3}+\frac{\epsilon}{3}+\frac{\epsilon}{3}=\epsilon$$
            \par Thus, for all $\epsilon>0$, we have that $d(x,f(x))<\epsilon$. Thus, $d(x,f(x)) \leq 0$, and hence $d(x,f(x))=0$. Consequently, $f(x)=x$, and so $f$ is not a fixed-point-free map.
            \end{proof}
            
        \item We show that the unit ball, $B^n$, in $\E^n$, with $(1,0,...,0)$ removed does not exhibit the fixed point property: 
            \begin{proof} Let $p=(1,...,0)$. Consider the function $f:B^n\setminus \{p\} \rightarrow B^n\setminus \{p\}$, defined by $f(x) = \frac{x+p}{2}$. We show that $f$ is continuous: 
            \par Let ${\Ocal}$ be an open set in $B^n\{p\}$. Let $x \in f^{-1}({\Ocal})$. Then $f(x) \in {\Ocal}$, and since ${\Ocal}$ is open there exists an $r>0$ such that $B_r(f(x))\subset {\Ocal}$. Let $y\in B_{2r}(x)$. Then $|x-y|<2r$. Then, 
            $$|f(x)-f(y)|=|\frac{x+p}{2}-\frac{y+p}{2}|=\frac{1}{2}|x-y|<r$$
            Thus, $y\in B_r(f(x))$. Hence, $y\in f^{-1}({\Ocal})$. Thus, $B_{2r}(x)\subset f^{-1}({\Ocal})$. Therefore, $f^{-1}({\Ocal})$ is open and $f$ is continuous.
            \par Further, $f$ does not have the fixed-point property; If $f(x) = x = (x_1,..., x_n)$, then we have $2x = x+p$. Implying that $x_i = 2x_i$, $2 \leq i \leq n$. Thus, $x_i = 0$. However, then the only solution to $x_1 + 1 = 2x_1$ is $x_1 = 1$. This is a contradiction since we must have $x = p \notin B^n\setminus\{p\}$. 
            \end{proof}
            
        \item We show that the one-point union of $X$ and $Y$, $X \vee Y$, has the fixed-point property if, and only if, both $X$ and $Y$ have it:
            \begin{proof} 
            $ $\newline
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item[] ($\implies$): Suppose that the one point union $X\vee Y$ has the fixed-point-property. Let $f:X\rightarrow X$ be a map, and let $p$ be the point glued together in the one point union. Then, define $g:X\vee Y\rightarrow X\vee Y$, as $g(x)=f(x)$, if $x\in X$, and $g(x)=f(p)$, if $x \in Y$. By the gluing lemma, $g$ is a continuous map and so, by hypothesis, has a fixed point $x_0$. Note that $g$ is a map into $X$. Thus the fixed point must be in $X$. Hence, by construction, $x_0=g(x_0)=f(x_0)$, so that $f$ has a fixed point. Similarly, any continuous function from $Y$ to itself has a fixed point.
                    \item[] ($\impliedby$): Suppose $X$ and $Y$ have the fixed point property and let $f:X\vee Y\rightarrow X\vee Y$ be a map. Then, suppose $f(p)\in X$, and define a map $g:X\rightarrow X$ such that $g(x)=f(x)$, if $f(x)\in X$, and $g(x)=p$, if $f(x)\notin X$. Then, since $g$ is continuous, it has a fixed point. By construction, the fixed point must be one $x = g(x) = f(x)$. Thus, $f$ has a fixed point. Next, suppose $f(p)\in Y$, and define a map $g:Y\rightarrow Y$ such that $g(y)=f(y)$, if $f(y)\in Y$, and $g(y)=p$, if $f(y)\notin Y$. Then, since $g$ is continuous, it has a fixed point. By construction, the fixed point must be one $y=g(y)=f(y)$. Consequently, $f$ has a fixed point.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{proof}
        
        \item How does changing 'continuous function' to 'homeomorphism' in the definition of the fixed-point property affect problem $33$, $37$?
            \begin{proof} We first examine problem $33$: 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item[] $S^2$: This topological space would not exhibit the fixed point property. We know that the antipodal map is a homeomorphism which leaves no points fixed. 
                    \item[] $S^1 \times S^1$: Likewise, the antipodal map on each component, $S^1$, provides another counter example.
                    \item[] $\Int{D}$: Neither does this space have the homeomorphic fixed point property. To see this, we note that $\Int{D} \simeq \E$, and the map $g: \E \rightarrow \E$, given by $g(x) = x+1$ is a homeomorphism which leaves no points fixed.
                    \item[] $X \bigvee Y$: First, consider the map $E_1: X \bigvee Y \rightarrow X \bigvee Y$, given by $E_1(x) = x$, if $x \in X -\{p\}$. And, $E_2(y) = e^{yi\nicefrac{\pi}{2}}$. Then, $E_1$ is a homeomorphism, which leaves $X$ fixed, except for $p$. Similarly, define $E_2$ for $Y$. Then, it follows that $E_2 \circ E_1:X \bigvee Y \rightarrow X \bigvee Y$ is a homeomorphism that leaves no points of $X \bigvee Y$ fixed. Thus, $X \bigvee Y$ does not exhibit the fixed point property\footnote{We make use of the previous proof; that is $X \bigvee Y$ has the fixed point propert iff $X$ and $Y$ both have it.}. 
                \end{itemize}
                \par Now, we examine problem $37$:
                \par This shape does not exhibit the homeomorphic fixed point property. Consider $\partial B^n = S^{n-1}$, and let $p = (1,0,...,0)$. Then, $B^n - \{p\} = \Int{B^n} \cup S^{n-1} - \{p\}$. Furthermore, without loss of generality, $S^{n-1} -\{p\} \simeq \{-p\}$.\footnote{See previous exercises.} It follows that $\Int{B^n} \cup S^{n-1} - \{p\} \simeq \Int{B^n} \cup \{-p\}$. To conclude, we exhibit a homeomorphism on $\Int{B^n} \cup \{-p\}$  which does not have a fixed point: 
                \par Consider $f: \Int{B^n} \cup \{-p\} \rightarrow \Int{B^n} \cup \{-p\}$ defined by 
                \[ f(x) = 
                    \begin{cases}
                    -x & x \notin \{-p, 0\} \\
                    0 & x = -p \\
                    -p & x = 0 
                    \end{cases}\]
                The fact that $f$ is 1-1 and onto is clear by construction. Further, $f$ is continuous, by the Gluing Lemma\footnote{Armstrong, pg. $69$.}. It follows that $f$ is a homeomorphism, as $f^{-1} \equiv -f$. However, $f$ clearly leaves no points fixed. 
            \end{proof}
            
    \end{enumerate}
