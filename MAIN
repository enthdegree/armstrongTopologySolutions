    \subsection{Homotopy Type}
        \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
            \item We prove that if $A$ is a subspace of a topological space $X$ and  $G: X \times I \rightarrow X$ is deformation retract relative to $A$, then $X$ and $A$ have the same homotopy type\footnote{Armstrong does not do a good job of defining a deformation retract. We use the following definition. "Strong" deformation retract: $A$ is a 'strong' deformation retract of $X$ iff there exists a map $D:X \times I \rightarrow X$ such that $D(a,t)=a$ for every $a \in A$, $D(x,0)=x$ and $D(x,1) \in A$ for all $x \in X$. See \href{http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/488527/deformation-retract-and-homotopy-equivalence}{this post on SE.}}: 
                \begin{proof} Indeed: Let $f:A \rightarrow X$ be the inclusion map and $g: X \rightarrow A$ be defined by $g(x) = G(x,1)$. We have previously shown that $f$ and $g$ are continuous. It is only left to show that $f \circ g \simeq 1_X$ and $g \circ f \simeq 1_A$:
                \par Direct computation shows that 
                    \begin{align*}
                        (g \circ f)(a) & = g(f(a)) = g(a) = G(a,1) = a,
                    \end{align*}
                while $f \circ g \simeq_G 1_X$. This completes the proof. 

                \end{proof}
            \item We show that any non-empty convex subset, $X$, of a euclidean space is homotopy equivalent to a point: 
                \begin{proof} 
                Without loss of generality, we assume that $X \subset \E^n$. We first show the existence of a deformation retract, $G: X \times I \hookrightarrow \{x\}$, where $x \in X$ is fixed:
                \par Let $G$ be defined as $G(y,t) = (1-t)y + tx$, for all $y \in X$. Then, clearly $G(y,0) = y$, and $G(y,1) = x \in \{x\}$ for all $y \in X$. So, $G$ is deformation retract. By the above, $X$ and $A$ are of the same homotopy type: null-homotopic. 
                \end{proof}
 
        \end{enumerate}

\section{Homotopy Type}
\par Throughout this section, $\simeq$ will typically denote homotopy equivalence.
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
        \item If $X \simeq Y$ and $X' \simeq Y'$, we show that $X \times X' \simeq Y \times Y'$: 
            \begin{proof} We are given maps $f: X \rightarrow Y$, $g: Y \rightarrow X$, $f':X' \rightarrow Y'$ and $g': Y' \rightarrow X'$, such that $g \circ f \simeq_{\gamma'} 1_X$, $f \circ g \simeq_{\gamma} 1_Y$, $g' \circ f' \simeq_{\delta '} 1_{X'}$ and $f' \circ g' \simeq_{\delta} 1_{Y'}$. 
            \par From the component-wise definition of the product topology, $F: X \times X' \rightarrow Y \times Y'$, defined by $F(x,x') = (f(x), f'(x'))$, and $G: Y \times Y' \rightarrow X \times X'$, defined by $G(y,y') = (g(y), g'(y'))$ are continuous. Further, $F \circ G \simeq 1_{Y \times Y'}$, and $G \circ F \simeq 1_{X \times X'}$, via the canonical maps, component-wise defined: $\mathcal{F}:(X \times X') \times I \rightarrow X \times X'$, $\mathcal{F} \equiv (\gamma', \delta')$, and $\mathcal{G}:(Y \times Y') \times I \rightarrow Y \times Y'$, $\mathcal{G} \equiv (\gamma, \delta)$, respectively. 
            \par Thus, $X \times X' \simeq Y \times Y'$.
            \end{proof}
            
        \item We show that the cone, $CX$, is contractible for any space $(X, \tau_X)$:
            \begin{proof} By definition, we have $CX = \nicefrac{X \times I}{X\times \{1\}}$. Define ${H}: CX \times I \rightarrow CX$ by $${H}((x,t),s) = (x, t(1-s))$$ Then, we have 
                \begin{align*}
                    {H}((x,t), 0) & = (x,t) = 1_{CX} \\
                    {H}((x,t),1) & = (x,0) 
                \end{align*}
            Now, if $\Ocal_{CX} \in \tau_{CX}$, then $H^{-1}(\Ocal_{CX}) = (\Ocal_{CX}, I) \in  CX \times I$. Thus, $H$ is continuous. This proves the result. 
            \end{proof}
    
        \item We show that the punctured torus deformation retracts onto the one-point union of two circles. 
        
        \item For each of the following cases, we choose as base point in $C$ and describe the generators for the fundamental groups of $C$ and $S$. Further, we write down the homomorphism, in terms of these generators, the fundamental groups induced by the inclusion of $C$ in $S$. 
        \par Consider the following examples of a circle $C$ embedded in a surface $S$: 
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item $S = \text{M{\"o}bius Strip}$ and $C = \partial S$: 
                \item $S = S^1 \times S^1 = T^1$ and $C = \{(x.y) \in T^1 : x = y\}$:
                \item $S = S^1 \times I$ and $C = S^1 \times 1$:
            \end{enumerate}
            
        \item Suppose that $f,g: S^1 \rightarrow X$ are homotopic maps. We prove that the spaces formed from $X$ by attaching a disc, using $f$ and using $g$ are homotopy equivalent; in other words, we prove that $X \cup_f D \simeq X \cup_g D$: 
        
        \item We use the previous problem, and the third example of homotopy given in section $5.1$, to show that the 'dunce hat' has the homotopy type of a disc, and is therefore contractible: 
        
        \item We show that the 'house with two rooms' is contractible: 
        
        \item We give a detailed proof to show that the cylinder and the M{\"o}bius strip have the homotopy type of the circle: 
        
        \item Let $X$ be the comb space. We prove that the identity map of $X$ is not homotopic $\text{rel} \{p\}$, to the constant map, $p$. 
        
        \item \textit{FTA}: We prove the fundamental theorem of algebra: 
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem}
\par Throughout, we say a topological space $(X, \tau_X)$ has the fixed-point property if every continuous function from $X$ to itself has a fixed point. 

    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
        \item We determine which of the following have the fixed point property: 
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The $2$-Sphere: $S^2$ does not exhibit the fixed point property. 
                    \begin{proof}
                    We have previously shown that the map $f:S^n \rightarrow S^n$, given by $f(x) = -x$ is a homeomorphism.
                    \end{proof}
                    
                \item The Torus: $T^1 = S^1 \times S^1$ does not exhibt the fixed point propert. 
                    \begin{proof}
                    As $T^1 = S^1 \times S^1$, and the antipodal map, $f$, on $S^1$ is a homeomorphism, we have that $F: T^1 \rightarrow T^1$, defined by $F((x,y)) = (f(x),f(y))$, is continuous and doesn't exhibit the fixed point property. 
                    \end{proof}
                    
                \item The interior of the unit disc: $\text{Int}D^1$ does not exhibit the fixed point property: 
                    \begin{proof}
                    \end{proof}
                    
                \item The one point union of two circles: $S^1 \vee S^1$
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
